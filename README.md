# Solubility_Prediction
## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection.

- Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest.

- Visualization of model performance using actual vs. predicted plots and residual plots.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

- XGBoost

- Joblib (for model saving and loading)
